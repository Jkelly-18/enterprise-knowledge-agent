# Enterprise HR Agent

**Live Demo:** https://enterprise-hr-agent.netlify.app

## Project Overview

Aria is an AI-powered enterprise HR agent built as a portfolio project to demonstrate how modern AI agent architecture can solve real enterprise problems at scale. The application integrates a retrieval augmented generation pipeline, a reasoning agent with tool use, vector search, and a relational database into a single deployable full stack system.

## Case Example: Velo

Velo is a fictional B2B SaaS company building marketing analytics software. With 74 employees across 8 departments and hiring aggressively, Velo is scaling faster than its internal knowledge systems can keep up with.

New employees are joining Engineering, Sales, and Customer Success every month. Each cohort arrives with the same questions. What is my PTO allowance? How do I submit an expense report? What tools do I need to set up? What should I be doing in my first 30 days?

The knowledge to answer all of these questions exists. It lives across 13 internal documents including the employee handbook, role specific onboarding guides, benefits documentation, and team process runbooks. But employees do not know where to look, and when they cannot find the answer they ask their manager. Managers across all 8 departments are fielding the same repetitive questions from every new hire cohort, pulling them away from the work that actually drives the business. HR is handling a constant stream of basic requests that could be self served. Onboarding is slower and more expensive than it needs to be.

---

## The Solution

Aria gives every Velo employee instant, personalized answers without involving a manager or waiting for an HR response.

Employees ask questions in plain language. Aria determines whether the answer lives in a company document or in the employee database, queries the right source or both simultaneously, and returns a single accurate answer grounded in real data. A new engineer asking about their first 30 days gets the engineering onboarding plan. A six year VP asking about PTO gets told they are on the unlimited tier based on their actual start date pulled directly from the database. Every answer is specific to who is asking.

The agent also surfaces each employee's active PTO requests and expense reports directly in the interface, giving employees a single place to both ask questions and track their own HR activity.

## How It Works

### RAG Pipeline

13 internal HR documents are chunked into 800 character overlapping segments using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with 150 character overlap to preserve context at chunk boundaries. Each chunk is embedded using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model and stored in ChromaDB with metadata including document category and relevant employee role. At query time the user's question is embedded and the top 5 most semantically similar chunks are retrieved as grounding context for the LLM.

### LangGraph ReAct Agent

The agent is built on LangGraph's ReAct architecture. On each turn the LLM reasons about what information it needs, selects a tool, executes it, observes the result, and decides whether to call another tool or synthesize a final answer. This loop allows the agent to combine results from multiple sources in a single response rather than following a fixed retrieval path.

The agent has access to two tools:

- **search_company_docs:** semantic search over the ChromaDB vector store, filtered by employee role metadata when relevant
- **query_employee_database:** natural language to SQL queries via LangChain's SQLDatabaseToolkit, giving the agent access to live employee records, department structure, and HR requests

### Dual Data Sources

Unstructured knowledge lives in ChromaDB as vector embeddings. Structured employee data lives in SQLite via SQLAlchemy and includes three tables: employees, departments, and hr_requests. The agent treats each as a separate tool and can query both within the same conversation turn, for example retrieving a PTO policy from documents while simultaneously looking up the user's exact start date from the database to calculate their specific tenure tier.

### Personalized System Prompt

Every agent session is initialized with a dynamically built system prompt containing the current user's name, role, department, persona type, and today's date. The prompt includes explicit rules for tenure based PTO calculation, role specific document retrieval, and SQL query patterns. This ensures every answer is grounded in who is asking rather than returning generic policy text.

### Conversation Memory

Chat history is maintained on the frontend and sent with every request so the agent can reference previous messages and build on earlier answers across a multi-turn conversation.

## Company Documents

The 13 internal Velo HR documents were generated using Claude as a writing tool to produce realistic, consistently branded company content. All documents are formatted as PDFs and total 13 pages of content across the following categories:

- **General Onboarding (1 document, 3 pages)**
New hire onboarding guide covering first day checklist, account setup, key contacts, company values, and new hire FAQ.

- **Role-Specific Onboarding (3 documents, 7 pages)**
Separate 30/60/90 day plans for Engineering, Sales, and Customer Success. Each plan defines success milestones, key contacts, and tool setup specific to that role. These documents are what make role-based retrieval meaningful — an engineer and a sales rep get completely different onboarding answers.

- **HR Policy (3 documents, 9 pages)**
Employee handbook covering PTO tiers by tenure, sick leave, remote work policy, performance reviews, and offboarding. Benefits guide covering health insurance, 401k matching, parental leave, and learning stipends. Expense and reimbursement policy covering submission process in Expensify, approval thresholds by role level, and common mistakes to avoid.

- **IT and Security (2 documents, 4 pages)**
IT security policy covering device requirements, password standards, data classification tiers, and incident reporting. Tech stack and tools guide covering every software platform the company uses across Sales, Engineering, HR, and Finance with access instructions.

- **Internal Processes (3 documents, 8 pages)**
Engineering team processes covering sprint structure, ticket lifecycle, code review standards, and deployment process. Sales playbook covering ICP definition, six stage pipeline, MEDDIC discovery framework, objection handling, and deal desk approvals. Customer success runbook covering account health scoring, onboarding process, QBR structure, escalation tiers, and churn risk signals.

- **Company (1 document, 3 pages)**
Company mission, core values, OKR framework, and current quarter company OKRs with key results.

## Employee Database

The SQLite database is seeded on every deployment by `scripts/seed_database.py` using the Faker library for bulk employee generation and manually written data for the four demo personas. The database contains:

- **74 employees** across 8 departments with realistic roles, salaries, and start dates
- **8 departments** with team leads, budgets, and Slack channels
- **12 HR requests** covering a mix of PTO requests and expense reports tied to each demo persona with pending and approved statuses

The four demo personas are hardcoded with specific start dates to cover all three PTO tiers: Sarah Chen at 5 days tenure (PTO accrued proportionally), Marcus Webb at 2.5 years (25 days), Priya Patel at 3 years (25 days), and Jordan Blake at 6 years (unlimited).

---

## Demo Personas

The portal includes four employee profiles that can be switched using the Switch Employee button. Each persona has a different role, department, and tenure, allowing the same question to produce meaningfully different answers depending on who is asking.

| Name | Role | Department | Tenure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sarah Chen | Junior Software Engineer | Engineering | 5 days |
| Marcus Webb | Sales Manager | Sales | 2.5 years |
| Priya Patel | HR & Operations Lead | Operations | 3 years |
| Jordan Blake | VP of Customer Success | Customer Success | 6 years |

Try asking the same question as each persona to see how the agent personalizes its answer based on role, department, and tenure data from the database.

## Deployment Architecture

**Backend: Railway**

The FastAPI backend is deployed on Railway and connected directly to this GitHub repository. Railway automatically redeploys on every push to the main branch. On each deployment the startup command runs `seed_database.py` to recreate the SQLite database and `ingest_docs.py` to re-embed all 13 documents into ChromaDB before starting the uvicorn server. This ensures the database and vector store are always fresh without needing to commit binary files to the repository.

The API is rate limited using slowapi. The chat endpoint is limited to 10 requests per minute per IP address and all other endpoints are limited to 30 requests per minute.

**Frontend: Netlify**

The React frontend is built with Vite and deployed to Netlify as a static site. The compiled `dist/` folder is uploaded to Netlify. The frontend communicates with the Railway backend via axios HTTP requests. All API keys and secrets are stored as environment variables on Railway and never exposed to the browser.

## Evaluation

The system was evaluated using representative enterprise HR and onboarding scenarios to verify that the agent could correctly combine structured employee data with unstructured company documents when answering personalized questions.

Example scenarios tested included:

- **PTO accrual for new employees within their first year**  
  Verified that the agent checked the employee's exact start date and tenure in the database before determining the correct PTO accrual logic rather than returning a generic PTO policy answer.

- **Team member and department questions**  
  Verified that the agent could answer questions about an employee's team structure, department context, and related employee details using database-backed information.

- **Personalized PTO and department-level policy questions**  
  Verified that for questions involving PTO eligibility or department-relevant guidance, the agent first referenced structured employee context such as role, department, and tenure, then retrieved the most relevant policy or onboarding documents for that specific employee.

- **Role-specific onboarding guidance**  
  Verified that employees in different roles received different answers when asking the same onboarding question, based on role-aware retrieval over the company document set.

- **Employee-specific HR activity**  
  Verified that the system could retrieve active PTO requests and expense reports tied to the current employee persona.

These scenarios were used to confirm that the agent could correctly choose between database querying, document retrieval, or a combination of both depending on the question type and the employee context.

## Limitations

This project is designed as a portfolio demonstration of an enterprise AI workflow and includes several intentional limitations that would need to be addressed in a production deployment.

- **Demo-scale data**  
    The employee records, HR requests, and company documents are smaller and simpler than those in a real enterprise environment. The project is designed to demonstrate the workflow and architecture rather than production-scale data complexity.

- **LLM reliability**  
  Like any LLM-based system, responses may occasionally be incomplete or overly confident if retrieval misses relevant context or the model reasons incorrectly.

- **SQL and tool-use guardrails**  
  The database querying workflow is effective for demonstration purposes, but production use would require stronger validation, monitoring, and guardrails around tool behavior.

- **Authentication and access control**  
  The application simulates personalization by persona, but it does not implement enterprise-grade authentication, authorization, or document-level permissions.

- **Evaluation scope**  
  Validation is currently based on representative functional scenarios and live demo testing rather than a fully automated evaluation framework.

## Running Locally

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, OpenAI API key

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jkelly-18/enterprise-hr-agent.git
cd enterprise-hr-agent
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment**

The virtual environment isolates Python dependencies for this project.
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
source venv/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux
```

**3. Install Python dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Create your .env file**

The `.env` file is not included in the repository for security reasons.
Create it manually in the root directory with the following contents:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./internal_data/velo.db
CHROMA_PATH=./internal_data/chroma
```

You can get an OpenAI API key at platform.openai.com. The database and
ChromaDB paths are created automatically in the next step.

**5. Seed the database and ingest documents**

These scripts generate the SQLite database and load all 13 documents
into ChromaDB. They must be run before starting the backend.
```bash
python scripts/seed_database.py
python scripts/ingest_docs.py
```

**6. Start the backend**
```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**7. Install Node dependencies and start the frontend**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
